            <h2>About Me</h2>
           
            <p> <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Sorry Image not found">My name is John Hansberry, and I am 24 years old. I currently work as a manager at Joe Canal's Discount Liquor in Delran, but am looking for a career change. So far I am really enjoying this program and cannot wait to see what else I can learn.
            <br> <br>
            In my freetime I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, friends, and watching sports. Especially any of the Philadelphia teams. I am also an avid gamer and enjoy playing all types of games from Madden to Fortnite to Dark Souls, and all those in between.
